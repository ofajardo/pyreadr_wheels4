  # you can remove "build.cmd" from the front of the command, as it's
  # only needed to support those cases.
  # Note that you must use the environment variable %PYTHON% to refer to
  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python version you want to use on PATH.
  #- "build.cmd %PYTHON%\\python.exe setup.py test"

  # This step builds your wheels.
  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for

  # interpreter
